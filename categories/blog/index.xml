      <description>Is AI making the same mistakes as us? I watched the Netflix documentary CodedBias last weekend. And it raised some rather good points about AI development. For those of you who havenâ€™t yet seen the film, it tells the story of a group of inspiring women fighting against the dark side of AI. The documentary feels like a natural follow-up to the film SocialDilemma. And, if you were horrified by the practices uncovered in it, I strongly recommend you also watch CodedBias!</description>
